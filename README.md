We just received 99.95% accuracy in our credit card fraud detection. This number should not be surprising as our data was balanced towards one class. The good thing that we have noticed from the confusion matrix is that — our model is not overfitted.

Finally, based on our accuracy score — XGBoost is the winner for our case. The only catch here is the data that we have received for model training. The data features are the transformed version of PCA. If the actual features follow a similar pattern then we are doing great!!
